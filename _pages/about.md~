**About me**

I am a mechanical design engineer experienced in full life cycle development from concept, prototype, production, and support. 

I have spent much of my short career designing, prototyping, creating models, and maintaining mechanical documentation using Solidworks.

I have prototyped things using rapid manufacturing techniques including 3d printing, laser cutting, 2d and 3d cncs, manually machining parts with mills and lathes. When these techniques do not work I have interfaced directly with vendors who have the capital and skills to make what I cannot.

To complete all my projects I had to work with a multidiscipinary team to combine my mechanical designs with the electrical and software portions of the system.
