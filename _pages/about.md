title: Jason Savery - Mechanical Design Engineer
---

My name is Jason Savery and I am a mechanical design engineer. I created this site to serve as a portfolio and resume to highlight the projects I have worked on so far in my career. 

[Resume PDF](/downloads/JasonSaveryResume.pdf)

Over the last few years I have had the opportunity to create a compettive radio controlled airplane and help created a vehicle based drive by thermal data acquisition system. I have spent much of this time creating mechanical parts, integrating the electrical systems into these mechanical parts, and testing the final product to iterate on the design and make it better. 

In every project I have worked on I have had to wear many hats, serving as a go to person to understand the complete system and how each individual part combines to make the whole system. I have managed the fabrication either by interfacing with vendors or making the part either by myself or in conjunction with the team I have worked with. 

I have a passion for designing and making things where mechanical parts interact with electrical and computer systems. I have experience in a startup enviroment and I am always interested in new opportunities.
